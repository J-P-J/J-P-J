# Jerome Pascal Janson - Data Analysis Portfolio

## About

Hi, I'm Pascal \
I have a background in electrical engineering specialized in renewable energies. \
While I was writing my thesis on this subject there were some issues that led me to have to cancel the work on my thesis and look for a job.

The topic of my thesis was the analysis of requirements for electric energy storages in germany on a district level. \
In that I analyzed the energy production of the german district and the energy consumption. \
The goal was to analyze how much energy storages should be build in each district when the energy production is only done by renewable energies.

I had practical experiences in Shangahi, China where I worked as an intern in an energy-focused company. \
There I was in the team that created a database of companies (similarly to LinkedIn) and I was responsible for developing programs to automatically
crawl neccessary data and clean and upload that into a database.

During my studies I also worked in a major german energy company EnBW as a working student. \
There I helped the condition monitoring team to monitor wind turbines.

I have worked as a consultant for a german startup company that specializeses in databases and cloud computing but am now looking for another field to work in.
